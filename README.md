<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![node carplay Screen Shot](https://i.imgur.com/egkvgau.png)

[example video](https://youtu.be/mBeYd7RNw1w)

This is a carplay module for nodejs. It is currently in development, but is at a useable stage. Currently it interacts with a Carlinkit adapter, it opens communication with it, sends various
configuration settings and also downloads the APK file thats usually used with it. The APK file then gets extracted and its contents get sent over usb to the
dongle itself. The dongle then sends a h264 bytestream from the phone, this contains the video data. And it also sends an audio stream.
