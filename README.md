<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Node Carplay in Chrome](https://github.com/rhysmorgan134/node-CarPlay/assets/4278113/3cbb5cab-fd62-4282-9fad-1b1aed90ad33)

[Example Video (outdated)](https://youtu.be/mBeYd7RNw1w)

This repository contains the npm package `node-carplay` that can be used on the Web or in Node.js. It allows interfacing with the [Carlinkit USB adapter](https://amzn.to/3X6OaF9) and stream audio/video on your computer. The package can be used in the Node.js environment using native USB bindings ([`libudev-dev` required](https://github.com/node-usb/node-usb#prerequisites)), or in Chrome (or equivalent browsers) using [`WebUSB` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebUSB_API).

There are multiple Carplay dongles on the market, the ones that convert wired to wireless carplay WILL NOT WORK. You need one that converts android/factory infotainment systems into Carplay (CPC200-Autokit or CPC200-CCPA etc). The package forwards video feed in h264, and PCM audio coming in from the USB dongle.

There's an included example `carplay-web-app` that runs in the browser and renders the Carplay environment. It supports mic input and audio output through Chrome audio stack as well as touch / mouse input.
